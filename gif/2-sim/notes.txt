The 3D dispersion calculation was for non-dispersive materials, which allowed me to use a pretty course simulation grid of 20 pixels / um. Going by increments of ten, it appears that going to dispersive materials requires 40 pixels / um which will push the run time to the hours time scale. The 20 pixels / um finished in a few minutes.
