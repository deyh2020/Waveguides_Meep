The 3D dispersion calculation was for non-dispersive materials, which allowed me to use a pretty course simulation grid of 20 pixels / um. Going by increments of ten, it appears that going to dispersive materials requires 40 pixels / um which will push the run time to the hours time scale. The 20 pixels / um finished in a few minutes. 

There are two MPB calculations, the first (dispersion_waveguide_layout_for_3DSim_MPB.png) is done also at 20 pixels / um and non-dispersive. This one should match! 

The second is done at 45 pixels per um (but for a smaller cell size), and is a full dispersive calculation for frequencies corresponding to .4 -> 1.77 um. I also plotted the light line of the substrate, which is the real constraint for guided modes.
